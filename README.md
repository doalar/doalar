# 👋 Hey, I'm Doruk Alp Arifagaoglu

Rooted in science, drawn to design — I explore how logic meets aesthetics.  
Through creative coding, I translate the language of life sciences into visual stories and interactive systems.

### 🔬 Life Sciences × 🎨 Creative Coding × 📊 Visual Design

I love exploring how code can visualize complex systems, whether it’s biological processes, generative forms, or data-driven art. I’m especially into:
- Interactive simulations and visual storytelling
- Translating biological phenomena into visual experiences
- Creative use of tools like **TouchDesigner**, **p5.js**, and **R**
